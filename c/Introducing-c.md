# 1.1 History of C

## Origins. 
- Unix operating system을 만들기 위해서 C언어가 탄생했다. 이는 기존의 assembly language 로는 debug도 힘들고 더 나은 코드로 만들기 어려웠다.

## Standardizations. 
- C compiler가 보급되면서 많은 OS에서 C를 사용하기 시작했는데 새로운 C compiler가 나올수록 범용성에 문제가 생기기 시작했다. 그래서 ANSI (American National Standars Institute)를 만들어 국제 표준을 만드려고 시도했다.

## C-Based Languages. 
1. Learning C can give you greater insight into the features of C++, Java, C#, Perl and the other C-based languages. 
2. There are a lot of older C programs around. 
3. C is still widely used for developing new software, especially in situations where memory or processing power is limited or where the simplicity of C is desired. 

# 1.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of C. 

## Philosophy. 
- C is a low-level language. 
- C is a small language. 
- C is a permissive language. 

## Strengths. 
- Efficiency. 
- Portability. 
- Power. 
- Flexibility. 
- Standard library. 
- Integration with UNIX. 

## Weaknesses
- C programs can be error-prone. 
- C programs can be difficult to understand. 
- C programs can be difficult to modify. 

## Effective Use of C
- Learn how to avoid C pitfalls. 
- Use software tools to make programs more reliable. 
- Take advantage of existing code libraries. 
- Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions. 
- Avoid “tricks” and overly complex code. 
- Stick to the standard.
